# Random_tree 
Simple software for generated random number based on QT

There wasn't based on any extra environment of Windows.

It only can generated 8-digit nonnegative integer (The soon version will support negative integer)

As you can see,the ui is quite simple which is because of my poorly ability of headend
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
